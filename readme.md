# Minimum Equivalent Digraph Algorithm with GUI

## How it works
1. Run GUI.java
2. On the left panel of the GUI, click anywhere you want the nodes of the graph to be placed until the graph is automatically finished and connected
3. Once the graph has been automatically connected, click on "Digrafo MÃ­nimo Equivalente" to display the Minimum Equivalent Digraph on the right panel
4. Click on "Reiniciar Dibujos" to reset the panels, then repeat from step 2

## Important information
There is a default graph set in the code as a test sample. This test sample can be changed as necessary to display any type of graph possible.
Alternatively, there is an option to take the graph by user input, which is not recommended.
